## 🚀 About Me

🚀Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) at University of Leeds while gaining hands-on experience with Large Language Models.

🤖 My technical experience focuses on building production-oriented ML and software systems, spanning backend development with Python and Kotlin, cloud-native infrastructure on AWS and GCP, and end-to-end deployment of intelligent services. I have worked with distributed systems concepts, RESTful APIs, and data-driven pipelines, and have applied DevOps practices including Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and AWS CDK.

💡I have hands-on experience developing and integrating machine learning models using PyTorch and TensorFlow, and exploring LLM-powered applications with tools such as LangChain, focusing on model inference, scalability, and system reliability rather than research-only experimentation. Always open to discussing software engineering opportunities, emerging tech, and innovative projects.

🔍I am especially interested in roles that emphasize ownership, operational excellence, and long-term system design, and where engineers are responsible for taking ideas from concept to production.
